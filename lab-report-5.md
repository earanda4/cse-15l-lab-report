Part 1:
Student: I believe there is something wrong with my code. My guess is that it's an infinite loop.

TA: Have you tried changing the while statement?

Part 2:

Reflection: Something I learned from this lab experience is how to form data structures and edit the files themselves straight from the command line. For instance, this last skill demo was all about being able to change files from the command line and it was by far my favorite skill demo of the four. Using the `mkdir` command to create new directories and the `touch` command in order to make new, but empty, files, I was able to form a brand new directory structure and update the github repository. Not only could I create new directory structures, but also edit the .java files within them by using the `vim` command. This allowed me to go inside the file and make changes using special commands. I found these commands to be the most interesting part of CSE 15L that I can use my knowledge of methods from CSE 11 and CSE 12 to edit files by using just the command line.
